# OnePlus 13T eSIM Provisioning Enabler (ColorOS)

A Magisk module to enable and expose the native eSIM provisioning interface for eUICC-enabled physical SIM cards (like 5ber, eSTK.me) within the standard ColorOS settings app.

This module does NOT enable your phone's internal, non-existent eSIM. It is exclusively for adding support for eUICC-enabled physical SIM cards.

## What This Module Does
This module allows you to manage eSIM profiles on a physical SIM card (such as 5ber or eSTK.me) using your phone's native settings menu. This makes it possible to add and manage eSIMs on your special SIM card directly through Settings > Mobile Network, just as if it were a built-in eSIM.

## Important Notes
- Prerequisites: You will likely need an unlocked bootloader and root access (e.g., Magisk) to apply this fix.
